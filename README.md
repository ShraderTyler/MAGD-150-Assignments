# MAGD 150
## README file

Within this readme files are some examples of coding that I did for MAGD 150 at UWW!

Small disclosure, these examples are slightly out of order from when they were submitted.

## Assignment 7

[Transormation Example](https://github.com/ShraderTyler/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s18_magd150_lab07Shrader/s18_magd150_lab07Shrader.pde)

This skecth is focused around the transformation of different elements. I was given the theme of "carnival" so I decided to make an "animated" clown face. The two eyes rotate seperately from each other while the nose bounces between the mouth and eyes.

## Assignment 8

[Typography Example](https://github.com/ShraderTyler/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s18_magd150_lab08Shrader/s18_magd150_lab08Shrader.pde)

For this sketch I was tasked with using text within a sketch. The theme for this skecth was "Movie Posters", so I based it off of my favorite super hero Moon Knight. This skecth has the "head" of Moon Knight fixed to the center page along with the title "Moon Knight" above it. Scrolling underneath Moon Knight is the phrase "From the dead" which is one of the major comics he appears in. 

## Assignment 2

[Color Example](https://github.com/ShraderTyler/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab02_Shrader/s18magd150lab02_Shrader/s18magd150lab02_Shrader.pde)

This sketch had the theme of "space" So I decided to experiment with a few different shades of color. The overall feel of this sketch is that there are two planets with a rocket ship traveling between them and a large star in the upper corner of the sketch. Something that was unintedend, for the "body" of the ship, when the sketch is run, it slowly fades into the color designated for it.

## Assignment 5

[Orginization Example](https://github.com/ShraderTyler/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/s18magd150lab05_Shrader/s18magd150lab05_Shrader/s18magd150lab05_Shrader.pde)

The theme for this sketch was "Television". I decided to make a "twist" on this theme and make it a "haunted" TV. The sketch consists of an old fashioned tv with two buttons. The "On" button causes the TV to flash white while the "Off" button causes the tv to flicker random colors.

## Assignment 10 Part 1

[Texture Example](https://github.com/ShraderTyler/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/gh-pages/texture/texture.pde)

For this sketch I was tasked with creating a texture that would be used in a later sketch designed around a 3D design. There was no specific theme set for this assignment so I decided to make a texture that looked like levels of water. The sketch is a small design of many ellipses that very in color as it moves towards the top of the sketch. Along with this, as soon as the sketch runs, the frame is immedietely saved into a .JPG file.
